Steps to generate jquery-ui.js
==============================

    - Go to https://jqueryui.com/download/
    - Under "Version", select "1.12.1 (Stable, for jQuery1.7+)"
    - Under "Components", uncheck "Toggle All". This deselects all other packages below that.
    - Under "Interactions", check "Draggable" and "Resizable". This would automatically select a few other packages.
    - Under "Theme", select "UI lightness"
    - Under "CSS Scope", type "#MagiCSS-bookmarklet" (without double-quotes)
    - Click on "Download"
    - This would download a file called "jquery-ui-1.12.1.custom.zip"
    - Extract "jquery-ui-1.12.1.custom.zip"
    - Use "jquery-ui.js" from the extracted folder
